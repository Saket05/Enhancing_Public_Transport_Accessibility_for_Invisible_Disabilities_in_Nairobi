# Enhancing_Public_Transport_Accessibility_for_Invisible_Disabilities_in_Nairobi
Challenge Background
This project aims to leverage mobile and AI technologies to address a critical urban accessibility challenge in Nairobi, potentially improving the daily lives of thousands of people with invisible disabilities while also raising public awareness and promoting a more inclusive society.

Nairobi, Kenya's capital, has a complex public transportation system including matatus (minibuses), buses, and the newly introduced Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. The city's population of over 4 million relies heavily on these services, but they can be challenging to navigate, especially for people with invisible disabilities.


The Problem
People with invisible disabilities (e.g., autism, chronic pain, hearing impairments) often struggle to communicate their needs in Nairobi's fast-paced and crowded public transportation system. This leads to misunderstandings, lack of accommodation, and potentially dangerous situations.


Goal of the Project
1. User Adoption:

Onboard 5,000 users with invisible disabilities in Nairobi within the first year.
Achieve a 70% retention rate after six months.
2. Communication Efficiency:

Reduce the average time needed to communicate specific needs by 50%.
Enable users to create custom messages within 3 taps.
3. Awareness and Accommodation:

Train at least 500 public transportation staff on responding to app-based communications.
Increase reported successful accommodations by 40% within the first year.
4. Localization:

Provide full functionality in both Swahili and English.
Incorporate at least 50 Nairobi-specific locations and scenarios.
5. Accessibility:

Ensure the app is usable by people with various disabilities, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
Achieve a user satisfaction rate of 85% for app accessibility features.
